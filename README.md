# MEDVSA EARBUD PROMOTIONAL WEBSITE

## Overview :snake:

This repository contains the code and assets for an interactive web-project, created as part of a motion graphics and web development assignment. The project includes an animated 3D model viewer with clickable hotspots, each revealing information about unique features when interacted with. The website which is still a work in progress will include a variety of scroll animations and different model viewings, as well as an x-ray slider to promote these snake/Medusa-themed buds.

## Features

- :skull_and_crossbones: **X-Ray Slider**: User controlled divider than can be moved to reveal the 'inside' of the buds
